# TCDev Utilities
This is a bunch of stuff taken from various repositories I created through the years. Some really old, some new stuff. Lots of handy extension methods I either wrote myself or taken from whatever other open source projects I can't remember anymore. 

Feel free to take anything you need, no license restrictions. If you find anything that helped you, please give a star ‚≠ê .

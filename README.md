# TCDev Utilities
This is a bunch of stuff taken from various repositories I created through the years. Some really old, some new stuff. Lots of handy extension methods I either wrote myself or taken from whatever other open source projects I can't remember anymore. 

Some of the things included are for example
* Useful extension methods on date, strings, collection types
* VSTO utility functions
* Some .NET Core wrapper functions
* ...more soon

Feel free to take anything you need, no license restrictions. If you find anything that helped you, please give a star ‚≠ê

* Over time i'll add more things, if you have anything you think is worth to add just add a PR
* Most of the things are grouped in respective sections, if you think anything should be in a different folder just add an issue
* If some of the older things are no longer working, let me know and i'll fix it.
